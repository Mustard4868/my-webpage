                    <br>
                    By day, you'll find me diving into the fascinating realm of CAD engineering, where I get to blend my
                    love for design with the precision of engineering. Whether it's crafting schematics or refining
                    intricate components, I'm all about bringing innovative ideas to life.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Beyond the academic and professional spheres, I'm a bit of a digital explorer. Programming and
                    cybersecurity are my side hustles, where I get to flex my problem-solving muscles and indulge my
                    curiosity. From coding up neat algorithms to keeping digital spaces safe and sound, I'm always up
                    for a challenge.
