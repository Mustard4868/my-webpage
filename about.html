                <p>Hello there!
                    <br><br>My name is Mustard and I am a student at the University of Applied Sciences in Groningen. I am currently in my fourth semester of the Electrical Engineering program.
                    <br><br>Besides my study I work as a part-time CAD Engineer for a company in my region. Here I work with a variety of CAD software. I have plenty of experience with progams such as Solidworks, AutoCAD, Inventor, and EdgeWise.
                    <br><br>I am passionate about technology and I am always looking for new ways to challenge myself and expand my knowledge. I am particularly interested in software development and automation.
                    <br><br>On this website, you can find some of the projects that I have worked on. I hope you enjoy your visit!
