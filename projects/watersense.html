                <ul>
                    <li>Learn about sensors and their applications</li>
                    <li>Arduino programming</li>
                    <li>Learn how to do research</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                <p>The goal of this project was to create a device that would help consumers test public bodies of water
                    for pollutants.
                    <br>This way the consumers can safely swim in public water without the risk of exposing
                    themselves to harmful contaminants.
                    <br>The first idea was to use a combination of sensors to test the
                    water and compare it to a “normal” value that has been decided earlier. The sensors that should be
                    included in the design are a pH sensor, a TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) sensor, a conductivity
                    sensor, and a temperature sensor.

                    <br><br>This project was a part of my education's second semester. The project was a group project.
                    <br>My main role in the project was to write the code for the Arduino and make the sensors work properly.
                    <br><br>It is imporant to take note that this is NOT a real product, and it has never been tested according to european standards. It is a prototype and a proof of concept.
                    <br><br>After finishing this project we learned that there is already a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense", target="_blank">US certification called WaterSense</a>, by no means are we affiliated with, or trying to impersonate this certificate.
