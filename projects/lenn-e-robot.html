                <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                <p>As of today "10-3-2024" I am still working on this project actively.
                    <br><br>LENN-E Robot is a project that I am working on with three other students. The project is part of our education's fourth semester.
                    <br>The goal of the project is to create a robot that can navigate a course mapped out by black lines and move a series of colored crates to their designated location.
                    <br><br>The robot is programmed in MicroPython and uses an ESP32 as its main controller. The robot is equipped with a variety of sensors and actuators to help it navigate the course and complete its mission.
                    <br>The project is still in its early stages and we are currently working on the robot's basic functionality.
                    <br><br>The project is managed using a KANBAN style planning board and we are using GitHub for version control. The project is expected to be completed by the end of the semester. I will update this page as the project progresses.
