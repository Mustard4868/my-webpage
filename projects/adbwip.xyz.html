                <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                <p>I first started learning Python when the popular discord bot "Groovy" was discontinued. Because I was
                    dissapointed I could no longer play music in my discord server, I decided to make my own bot.
                    <br><br>This project is my second attempt at making a discord bot, and I am using it to learn more
                    about Python.
                    <br><br>My first attempt was a simple bot that would replace the old music bot. I used FFMPEG to
                    make it work, but because google does not condone the use of their API for music streaming, I
                    decided to drop this feature and make a new bot that would be more useful to me and my friends.
                    <br><br>My new bot is called ADBWIP.xyz (Another Discord Bot Written In Python). It's a simple bot
                    that brings some funny and useful commands to my discord server.
                    ADBWIP uses the <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">discord.py</a> library to
                    interact with the discord API.
                    <br><br>The bot brings some fun commands such as "/cat" which pulls a random cat image and cat fact from
                    the
                    internet.
                    Besides the fun commands the bot also provides more useful commands such as "/poll" which allows you
                    to quickly create a poll
                    in the chat.
